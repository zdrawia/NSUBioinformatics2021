MissingOutputException in line 9 of /Users/vladimirleshkevich/GitProjects/NSUBioinformatics2021/Checkpoint_3/pipeline.txt:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
sra_data_fastqc.html
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 5 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 5
Shutting down, this might take some time.
