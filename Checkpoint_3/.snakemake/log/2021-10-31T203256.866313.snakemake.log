Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job stats:

Error in rule python:
    jobid: 1
    output: sra_data_answer.txt
    shell:
        python script.py sra_data_stat.txt | check.sh > sra_data_answer.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job python since they might be corrupted:
sra_data_answer.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
